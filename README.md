# Top 20 Brunch Places in Pittsburgh

This is a project with data from Yelp Data Challenge. You can view the final report on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/SijiaLi/235606). 
  
From this project you can see how I:
* perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) to check on word frequency and determine the mood behind reviews
* designed an algorithm to filter out the top 20 brunch spots in Pittsburgh based on rating and trending
* visualize the places using an interactive map.
